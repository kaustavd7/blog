Day 55 | 23-08-2025

I don't think you can fundamentally say FUCK Instagram. I really think, atleast one hour of scroll per week minimum is required.  
The reason being the ART  
I scrolled Instagram for an hour just now, after about a month of gap. (came back for vox-populi blog post) And I saw some posts, reels, ad about workshops, which I can never discover anywhere else than instagram.  
where will I find art?  
you just can't find art, such art, anywhere else.  
the photography, the niche fact about some artist, some crazy philosophy, dance, information about dance workshops  
I mean, where else?  
My feed in filled, flooded with sooo many good art pages and art, cinema, recommendations. It’s all soo good. It gets overwhelming.

And every time it shouts – to CREATE, CREATE, CREATE – to LIVE  
Write  
Dance  
Cinema  
Music

They say Bengalis are into art, I feel the Bengali inside me. Btw this would be first time in my life I have positive acknowledged my Bengali roots.  
Alternatives are books, friends and travel. even here, won't find many stuff, strictly available on insta.  
First of all, logistically you can’t have videos in books. Secondly...  
Why am in counting the reasons, obviously the substance Instagram offers is different than the one offered in books or live performances. 

But let me also state the conflict. Every story has one. I mean, why the fuck should you use Instagram, only few hour out of 24*7 hrs in a week.

The issue, the conflict arises, the energy drainage, the revolt for this app.  
Well this art, these soulful reels.   
It doesn’t STAYS.   
It comes, touches few of my senses, then poof the next brilliant art pops up, then poof, Tarantino cinema reel, poof, next deep quote by henry miller, it stirs something inside, saved, but wait, it’s gone. Poof. Next reel by sean lew, it stays for a bit, you rewatch, you share, you are in awe. You get back to your timezone. You realise, you are in this app longer than expected, feeling bit tired. But you again go back. Uff those vintage photos of mumbai, brilliant, saved. 
Next reel, stand up comedy. Gold stuff, laughed for a minute straight, shared with everyone. Poof. Next reel highlighting dialogue of some Iranian film. Ahh sometimes I wish to leave everything and roam around the globe with minimal resources. Next, edited jumpcuts with nostalgic bg-music of a film. Hmm, interesting. Will watch Chungking Express today. Next, bc kya beat pakda h. Crazzyy.  
By the end of it, you are mix of so many triggers and emotions. I feel tired, disoriented, in some different time zone, just eagerly waiting for next trigger. 

This should have been the pre-text.

As I was getting into dance, my scope of music broadened a lot, especially in high bpm zone. DHH, House, Afro. Also loads of other stuff from Elvis Presley to Seedhe Maut, from Norwegian Woods by Beetles to ISIS by Joyner Lucus. From Hips don’t Lie to Saibo. Well, Saibo was already in the list. Jazz? Not yet.  
Anyways, later when i received unwelcoming comments of my music taste from my didi and mamma, I realised I am enjoying this, because I can play with the noise, I am - with (hand to hand) each snare and bass unlike my mother, who is just hearing loud noise, like old broken television searching for signal.
Similarly musicians usually have very different taste than us – normal junta. They love playing with the counts. Crazy electric guitars, drums not following any 4-4 pattern, complete unpredictability.  
Similarly I feel, Instagram and their correspondings are truly actually enjoyable when you are also on the other side i.e. with the noise, creating content, building experiences, stirring emotions.
That’s why, I think that’s how influencers stay sane.

So, maybe I should advertise this blog page?
