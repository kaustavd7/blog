Day14 | 20-08-24

After the horrifying rape case in Kolkata, many humans around found themselves in the midst of excruciating, gruelling anger and pain, followed by a feeble state.
Not able to save that society which seems have just jumped off the roof, falling slowly, accelerating.

What can I do?  
Exactly what??? Is it possible to do anything tangible, at this stage of life?  
Let me iterate the q, do you actually want to do something for society, you are very much a part of, rape is just one of the weeds.

Why the popular outrage? 

> *'rape'* – violent crime involving forceful sexual intercourse (oxford defination), the most inhuman, heinous act. More heinous than murder, it’s the spiritual death of the society. As for living (dead) casualty/prey I don’t think my words could do justice.

It’s important to realise the spectrum, every entity has it.  
Do you think it’s binary? A long jump? Not-a-rapist -> Rapist?  
Obviously no, The Spectrum  
From disrespecting women to eyeing feminine body parts to inappropriate touches in crowded place to molestation to rape.

Where does one draw the societal line?  
I think what I can do, and 90% around me with similar age and power is to educate yourself, build your knowledge of reality and judiciary. Be someone who stands up when time comes. The concept of you are average of five person around you, applies to the person beside you as well. Be the north-star of his view. All boils down to one thing.  
Respect women. more so just be *human*.  
And then use this knowledge to fuel humans around you, with whatever power you have, be it a big por (any club) or nothing, you can anyday inspire your friends.
